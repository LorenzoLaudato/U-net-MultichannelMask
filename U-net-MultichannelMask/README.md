# U-Net: Semantic segmentation and classification with PyTorch
## Description
This model was trained from scratch with 12k images and scored a [Dice coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) of 0.988423 on over 100k test images.

It can be easily used for multiclass segmentation, portrait segmentation, medical segmentation, ...


## Usage
**Note : Use Python 3.6 or newer**

### Training

```console
> python train.py -h
usage: train.py [-h] [--epochs E] [--batch-size B] [--learning-rate LR]
                [--load LOAD] [--scale SCALE] [--validation VAL] [--amp]

Train the UNet on images and target masks

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --epochs E, -e E      Number of epochs
  --batch-size B, -b B  Batch size
  --learning-rate LR, -l LR
                        Learning rate
  --load LOAD, -f LOAD  Load model from a .pth file
  --scale SCALE, -s SCALE
                        Downscaling factor of the images
  --validation VAL, -v VAL
                        Percent of the data that is used as validation (0-100)
```

By default, the `scale` is 0.5, so if you wish to obtain better results (but use more memory), set it to 1.
